## Why

I got tired of it. Every article I open is the same recycled garbage. "In today's fast-paced digital landscape" — shut up. You can feel it in your gut when something was written by ChatGPT. The same filler words, the same structure, the same nothing.

So I thought: the older the article, the more likely a human actually wrote it. Anything before November 30, 2022 (when ChatGPT launched) is guaranteed human. After that? Roll the dice.

I built this tool to put that info right on the search results page. No clicking, no guessing. You see a green badge, you know a person wrote that. You see red, it's slop.

## What it does

grepHuman runs on Google search pages and adds a badge next to every result:

- **✓ Not AI** (green) — Published before ChatGPT existed. 100% human.
- **⚠ Maybe AI** (orange) — Published after Nov 30, 2022. Could go either way.
- **✖ AI Slop** (red) — The snippet is full of ChatGPT-speak. Emojis as bullet points, "dive into", "let's explore", "in today's digital landscape", the whole package.

You can also:
- Toggle labels on/off
- Hide AI/slop results entirely
- Show them back whenever you want

## Slop detection

The extension scans the search result snippet for patterns that ChatGPT loves:

- Filler phrases like "delve into", "harness the power", "game changer", "buckle up", "seamlessly", "cutting-edge", "navigate the complexities"
- Emoji spam and emojis used as list bullets (🔥 Title: ...)
- Hype emojis everywhere (🚀✅💡🎯⭐)
- Exclamation mark abuse

Each pattern adds to a slop score. Cross the threshold and you get the red badge.

npm install
